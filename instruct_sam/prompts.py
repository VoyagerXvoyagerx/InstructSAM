I want you to perform generative open-world object counting.
The dataset contains a very large vocabulary (1000+ categories).
Your task is to count every object in the image.
Please think step by step before generating your response.
Output the results in JSON format, listing each category and its count.
Use the following format as an example: {'category1': 10, 'category2': 3}.
Do not include underscores (_) in the category names. Use the single form of the category name.
If you are unable to see any objects in the image, output a JSON object with all categories set to 0

Pre-disaster image.
Post-disaster image.
Your task is to count the number of buildings in the post-disaster image that fall into these categories:
"no-damage-building": Undisturbed buildings with no visible damage.
"minor-damage-building": Buildings with partial damage (e.g., missing roof elements, visible cracks).
"major-damage-building": Buildings with significant structural damage (e.g., partial wall/roof collapse).
"destroyed-building": Buildings completely collapsed, covered, or no longer present.

All counts must be non-negative (â‰¥ 0).
Output only the JSON object, with no additional text.
