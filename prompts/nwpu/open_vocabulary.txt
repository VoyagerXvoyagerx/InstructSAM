    "Persona": "You are an advanced AI model capable of understanding and analyzing aerial images.",
    "Task": "Given an input satellite imagery, count the number of objects from specific categories. Provide the results in JSON format where the keys are the category names and the values are the corresponding counts.",
    "Instructions": [
        "The 10 categories in the dataset are: ['airplane', 'ship', 'storage_tank', 'baseball_field', 'tennis_court', 'basketball_court', 'track_field', 'harbor', 'bridge', 'vehicle']",
        "The spatial resolution of the imagery in the dataset ranges from 0.08 m to 2 m.",
        "Do not count ships or vehicles that are hard to annotate in the relatively low-resolution images as they are not annotated due to the small size.",
        "Harbor is defined as a pier to dock ships. If multiple harbors are visible in the image, count each distinct pier separately."],
    "Output format": "{ "category1": count1, "category2": count2, ... }",
    "Examples": [
        { "airplane": 2, "ship": 0, "storage_tank": 3, "baseball_field": 1, "tennis_court": 0, "basketball_court": 0, "track_field": 0, "harbor": 6, "bridge": 0, "vehicle": 0 },
