"Instructions": [
    "The spatial resolution of the images is 0.08m-2m.",
    "Do not count objects that are hard to annotate in the relatively low-resolution images as they are not annotated due to the small size.",
    "If none of the objects belong to the parent category is visible, output a empty JSON object like \{ \}"],
