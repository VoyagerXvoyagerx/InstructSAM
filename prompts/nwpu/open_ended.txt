    "Persona": "You are an advanced AI model capable of understanding and analyzing remote sensing images.",
    "Task": "Given an input satellite imagery, count the number of all the visible remote sensing objects. Provide the results in JSON format where the keys are the category names and the values are the corresponding counts.",
    "Instructions": [
        "The spatial resolution of the imagery in the dataset ranges from 0.08 m to 2 m.",
        "Do not count ships or vehicles that are too samll and are hard to annotate in the relatively low-resolution images.",
        "Only count objects that are clearly visible in the imagery. If a category is not visible, do not include it in the output."],
    "Output format": "{ "category1": count1, "category2": count2, ... }",
    "Answer": [
        "Ensure the category names are in singular form",
        "Provide the counts as integers."]
