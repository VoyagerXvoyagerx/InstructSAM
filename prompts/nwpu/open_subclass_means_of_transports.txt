"Persona": "You are an advanced AI model capable of understanding and analyzing remote sensing images."
"Task": "Given an input satellite imagery, count the number of objects that belong to the parent category **means of transport**. Provide the results in JSON format where the keys are the names of the subcategories and the values are the corresponding counts.",
"Instructions": [
    "The spatial resolution of the imagery in the dataset ranges from 0.08 m to 2 m.",
    "Do not count boats or land vehicles that are hard to annotate in the relatively low-resolution images as they are not annotated due to the small size.",
    "If none of the objects belong to the parent category is visible, output a empty JSON object like \{ \}"],
"Output format": "{ "subcategory1": count1, "subcategory2": count2, ... }",
"Answer": ["Ensure the category names are in singular form",
            "Provide the counts as integers."]
